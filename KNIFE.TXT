KNIFE NOTES

- the knife belongs to stratus
- he lost it long ago
- fenicia has known about the lost knife for a long time
- she's been kinda tracking it down in her spare time
- it eventually found its way to The Lighthouse
- it proved especially useful for the girls who work there, to defend 
themselves
- fenicia went to the Lighthouse partially to get the knife
- and partially for the other reason
- stratus intends to give the knife to nimbus
- nimbus gets annoyed when he learns that he has it only because 
fenicia saved the day (again) -- well, *his* day, at least (it's a 
personal matter)
