Fenicia's negotiation with Kail Sharktooth, aboard his nameless ship.

Sharktooth's POV: Stratus had successfully charted the location of >1 
of K's secret stashes across the archipelago. Stratus made this known 
by sending him a gift in a box, which turns out to be one of his own 
prized possessions that he put into a chest and buried himself.

What was the prized possession?

- a rare coin
- a grand chandelier
- something embarrassing, like a teddy bear or whatever
- a letter with a specific wax seal to prove authenticity
- an autographed portrait/daguerrotype

no, why would Stratus make it known?

- to send a threatening message: "we know what's up"
- OK so stratus didn't actually attach his name to it, but Sharktooth 
was able to put the pieces together
- a neverending game of one-up-beast-ship?

how does F get K's attention in such a way that he'd be willing to 
talk, rather than just kill her on the spot?

- she has something of his. -- ehh, that's super risky because when 
Stratus did that, it sent K in a violent rage and essentially killed 
Stratus over it.
- he gets tricked into being alone with F and Z
- most likely: F opens with the fact that F and K and Nimbus to go 
down. F does not reveal that she is the true leader of the Albatross, 
and instead makes up some other reason?
- F+Z cannot compensate him in money. how will they convince him?
- getting rid of the Albatross once and for all is payment enough?
- and is that literally getting rid of her, blowing her up (wow) or is 
it just a guarantee that they'll never cross paths again? 
- K will certainly like to have an ally, but if she can't say the truth 
about her being the captain of the Wanderer, then what?
- F+Z have their own ship that they bought/got from XXX on the island
- F+Z convince K that their operation is very small, nimble and 
secretive, and that's how they're able to get away with such a small 
vessel (basically a little sloop)

F+Z PLAN: They convince K to let them blow up the Albatross, they'll 
do this by transporting explosives on their tiny sloop, but in reality 
they're not planning on doing that (although maybe that's what'll 
happen anyway?) -- instead they're just gonna kidnap Nimbus?

Did Nimbus ever have a plan beyond just getting rid of Fenicia? He 
better have -- he *is* the villain of this story after all.

WHAT IS NIMBUS' FATE??

- fenicia kills him on purpose.
- fenicia kills him accidentally.
- fenicia forces him back into a regular crew member, and all is well. 
[X] yuck i hate it
- fenicia forces him to walk the plank. -- [X] unlikely because all 
the crew members would need to have their minds changed AGAIN about 
Fenicia's capabilities
- Fenicia kills him on purpose AND Z joins the Albatross again AND 
she is the captain of her own little ship.
- Fenicia blows up the ship while making sure Nimbus and the crew is 
alive, and then joins Sharktooth.
- Fenicia uses Sharktooth's power to overwhelm the Albatross without 
any bloodshed, and the dialogue happens in the open, which causes all 
of the crew members to reject him

(geez this has some SERIOUS Hamlet and Lion King undertones which I... 
am not liking, to be honest.)

- Sharktooth and the gang overwhelm the Albatross while Fenicia deals 
with Nimbus separately, 1-1
- (is this altercation actually happening on the high seas?)

- i'm kinda liking the blowing up the ship and she starts anew on her 
own ship ending... how to blow up the Albatross though?
- she is run aground on purpose, stuck in a sandbar (an excuse to have 
the shallow water bit that I keep imagining!)


K agrees to a plan: the little "ninja" sloop arrives in the dead of 
night while the Albatross has dropped anchor somewhere. in a stealth 
operation, she and K plant bombs.... hmm, someone's gonna find them. 
unless they're super well hidden. they *could* be, because she knows 
the ship super well... meh i'm not sure i like this idea anymore.

Albatross needs to hit a sandbar, or something, in order to stay put 
and to force everyone off the ship... or maybe it's docked in Port 
Sokuit because Nimbus has begun working on his political ambitions 
with the Waterwheel Revolutionaries.  ok I really like that.

AFTER THE MUTINY, Nimbus took care of the rest of the Albatross' 
duties (their privateer contracts, whatever those are called. letters 
of marque). when they were done, Nimbus ordered everyone back to *his* 
comfy home in the city, and HIS goal is to get reacquanited with the 
aristocracy. so, he's kinda (but not really) abandoned the ship. he 
uses the fact he has men reporting to him as a sort of armada, as 
leverage, but it isn't working out. i guess that is how Fenicia is 
able to recruit some of her old crew back.

No, Fenicia isn't the one who blows up the ship. It's Nimbus! what 
drives him to do it?

- he gives up. why does he give up? his over-ambition got the best of 
him. how does Fenicia make that happen? see, I don't like this beat 
because it takes so much agency out of F. that's why it has to be F. 
why does she do it? because of pressure from K -- is that enough?

there has to be a tough call made somewhere, if in fact the fate of 
the ship is that it is destroyed. she has to make the choice. what 
forces her into a position to make a choice?

does F do that without telling anyone? basically a twist ending, in 
that case. why would she do it? to rid herself of the captain's 
responsibility altogether. has she been craving NOT being captain? i 
need to come up with a reason to blow the ship up beyond it just being 
cool. omg i'm almost done fleshing out the story...

we also need to see Nimbus' downfall. how do we SEE it?

- F is in talks with Nimbus again? possible, how does Nimbus not want 
to kill her? he didn't REALLY wanna kill her, i guess he just wanted 
to fit in, but has no idea how -- and then kills himself in the 
burning ship... [X] that's too edgy for my tastes.
