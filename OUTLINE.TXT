------------------------------------------------

ACT 1. LEADING UP TO THE MUTINY

- Starry Vine sets sail from Port Sokuit
- 
- Fenicia makes a display of "bravery" & "valor" -- sea serpent/octopus?
- F saves Z and he is indebted to her (?)
- SV crew celebrates 
- Sharktooth ambushes SV
- Stratus to F: "He is not brave. He is simply unafraid."
- Sharktooth severely injures Stratus
- Stratus nominates Fenicia to be the next captain
- Stratus explains it shouldn't be Netto because he's getting old and his 
talents are better used elsewhere (Netto agrees)
- Stratus dies -> F becomes captain
- (Nimbus doctors/plants/makes conspicuous Stratus' map about 
Sharktooth's stuff)
- F needs to take the SV to the next mission
- F is superstitious about the normal route and commands the crew through 
a different route (she's also a little uneasy about her new role as 
captain)
- SV is damaged, they NEED to get emergency supplies -- genuinely 
her fault?
- "The smart thing would be for me to send someone else to get the 
supplies. But the RIGHT thing is that I need to fix this myself." She 
genuinely apologizes
- F utilizes fake map (Stratus' secret info about Sharktooth's stash) and 
digs up Sharktooth's chest
- Unfortunately, it is booby-trapped and sends a large, obnoxious flare 
into the sky -- fortunately, this was not onboard and nobody was killed
- Everyone notices this, Nimbus++ and Fenicia--;
- (Nimbus didn't know that this would happen, but he doesn't care, it just 
makes her fall even more spectacular)
- Nimbus formally announces the mutiny
- Nimbus and his immediate cronies get the plank ready
- F walks the plank and falls into the water
- Z steals a liferaft and saves her
- F and Z paddle to a nearby-ish island

ACT 2. ON THE ISLAND, DEBATING WHETHER TO GO BACK

- They end up at a small, but inhabited island called XXX
- The residents are very polite & acommodating
- F doesn't want word to spread that she is a disgraced and undecorated 
ship captain
- F and Z befriend someone
- F and Z are given the nickname "The Mermaids"
- A courier gives F a note, ultimately from Netto: he has reason to 
believe that Nimbus staged the mutiny falsely
- F doesn't believe it because she did actually endanger the crew with the 
Crazy Passage route
- F takes up *SOME ACTIVITY* to occupy time, heal her ego, and make some 
money while stuck here (it's the same hobby of hers while she was on the 
ship)
- Another bit of information reaches town to suggest that the mutiny was 
false
- A fun party among new friends, a regional feast with roasted 
albatross
- F walks out of the party
- "Mufasa and Simba" moment with the fireflies and Fenicia's eye/patch -- 
a discussion about abuse??
- "Does it hurt?" -- "Not anymore."
- F clings onto Z
- F resolves to reclaim the SV

ACT 3. THE RETURN

- F and Z travel to Port Sokuit to seek out the Sharktooth recruiter
- F meets Sharktooth himself
- F+Z tell Kail that they could work together to get rid of Nimbus
- Kail agrees
- We learn that the reason why K nearly killed Stratus at that 
skirmish is because he discovered that Stratus had charted K's secret 
stash
- F,Z (and K?) confront Nimbus
