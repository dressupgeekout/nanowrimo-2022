------------------------------------------------

ACT 1. LEADING UP TO THE MUTINY

- Starry Vine sets sail from Port Sokuit
- Fenicia makes a display of "bravery" & "valor" -- sea serpent/octopus?
- F saves Z and he is indebted to her (?)
- SV crew celebrates
- Sharktooth ambushes SV
- Stratus to F: "He is not brave. He is simply unafraid."
- Sharktooth severely injures Stratus
- Stratus nominates Fenicia to be the next captain
- Stratus explains it shouldn't be Netto because he's getting old and his
talents are better used elsewhere (Netto agrees)
- Stratus dies -> F becomes captain
- (Nimbus doctors/plants/makes conspicuous Stratus' map about
Sharktooth's stuff)
- F needs to take the SV to the next mission
- F is superstitious about the normal route and commands the crew through
a different route (she's also a little uneasy about her new role as
captain)
- SV is damaged, they NEED to get emergency supplies -- genuinely
her fault?
- "The smart thing would be for me to send someone else to get the
supplies. But the RIGHT thing is that I need to fix this myself." She
genuinely apologizes
- F utilizes fake map (Stratus' secret info about Sharktooth's stash) and
digs up Sharktooth's chest
- Unfortunately, it is booby-trapped and sends a large, obnoxious flare
into the sky -- fortunately, this was not onboard and nobody was killed
- Everyone notices this, Nimbus++ and Fenicia--;
- (Nimbus didn't know that this would happen, but he doesn't care, it just
makes her fall even more spectacular)
- Nimbus formally announces the mutiny
- Nimbus and his immediate cronies get the plank ready
- F walks the plank and falls into the water
- Z steals a liferaft and saves her
- F and Z paddle to a nearby-ish island

ACT 2. ON THE ISLAND, DEBATING WHETHER TO GO BACK

- They end up at a small, but inhabited island called XXX
- The residents are very polite & acommodating
- F doesn't want word to spread that she is a disgraced and undecorated
ship captain
- F and Z befriend someone
- F and Z are given the nickname "The Mermaids"
- A courier gives F a note, ultimately from Netto: he has reason to
believe that Nimbus staged the mutiny falsely
- F doesn't believe it because she did actually endanger the crew with the
Crazy Passage route
- F takes up *SOME ACTIVITY* to occupy time, heal her ego, and make some
money while stuck here (it's the same hobby of hers while she was on the
ship)
- Another bit of information reaches town to suggest that the mutiny was
false
- A fun party among new friends, a regional feast with roasted
albatross
- F walks out of the party
- "Mufasa and Simba" moment with the fireflies and Fenicia's eye/patch --
a discussion about abuse??
- "Does it hurt?" -- "Not anymore."
- F clings onto Z
- F resolves to reclaim the SV

ACT 3. THE RETURN

- F and Z travel to Port Sokuit to seek out the Sharktooth recruiter
- F meets Sharktooth himself
- F+Z tell Kail that they could work together to get rid of Nimbus
- Kail agrees
- We learn that the reason why K nearly killed Stratus at that
skirmish is because he discovered that Stratus had charted K's secret
stash
- F,Z (and K?) confront Nimbus

---------------------------------------------------

ok here's the second story i just came up with, the one which leans
into the "sharktooth has a technical genius on his crew" thing

SHARKTOOTH WANTS TO GET RID OF THE STARRY VINE who is his competition

- nimbus is in the navy
- NIMBUS WANTS TO BE IN THE WATERWHEEL ELITE and also GET OUT OF THE
CORNER HE PAINTED HIMSELF INTO
- he tries to chummy it up with some important people
- he falsely claims that he manages a network of mercenaries -- a kind
of a spur of the moment lie that got the attention of the people he
wanted attention from
- nimbus gets in touch with sharktooth operatives in Sokuit
- sharktooth hires "Mx. Manta" who is a techno wizard l33t
- nimbus is brought onto sharktooth's crew
- nimbus voluntarily quits the navy, honorable discharge
- nimbus keeps in touch with stratus, sort of a job interview, he
learns about the crew and especially Fenicia
- stratus knows his nephew is an able seaman because of his time at
the navy
- stratus sends invitation to SV (nimbus accepts it immediately ->
unopened envelope)

- Mx. Manta designs the Chimeracles with radio capabilities
- nimbus knows about them
- Mx. Manta is able to build and deploy the Chimeracles, one of them
goes rogue
- ...

---------------------------------------------------

no actually we can keep it simple. sharktooth has a longstanding
rivalry with SV. sharktooth does NOT have a rapport with Nimbus. but
he WILL once Nimbus is the captain. nimbus motivates the mutiny in the
'usual' way. sharktooth did hire Mx. Manta to give him an edge, but
Manta's "Chimeracle" invention never succeeds. so that means Mx. Manta
is out of a job. does Nimbus hire them?

-------------------------------------------------

Nimbus wants to join the Waterwheel Elite. he lies about his mercenary
network to people at the waterwheel, in order to get the attention of
people he wants attention from. now he needs to find a bunch of
mercenaries. he realizes that if he has a privateering business like
his uncle, then he'll have a bunch of people he can control very, very
quickly. he quits the navy to stay closer with his uncle and his
privateering business. stratus is ok with this because he knows his
nephew is an able seaman. nimbus expects to be in charge, or at least
strongly influence his uncle, to indicate to the waterwheel folks that
he does actually have a bunch of mercenaries. so the other reason why
stratus is ok with his nephew is because the nephew DOES have
connections to people with lots of money AND are willing to interact
with pirates to do pirate things. the wealthy benefactor who funds the
voyage to Ucrostica is XXX YYY who nimbus put directly in contact w/
stratus. unfortunately, stratus is killed because sharktooth knew
where to find them, because the Chimeracle has geolocation capabilities.
fenicia takes his place. however, Fenicia gets in the way of his plan.
b/c he isn't actually in charge -- rather, he was only able to get
stratus to listen because he is his uncle.

so, he has to get rid of fenicia in order to maintain the ruse. nimbus
is able to weaponize the confidential information about sharktooth to
depose fenicia, and he is able to do that in the first place because
he has manipulated his uncle into divulging those details to him. the
plan works. he does the thing in the original letter of marque and
then immediately returns to Port Sokuit and promptly forgets about the
crew, because the family of SV never meant anything to him anyway,
it's jut a bargaining chip. the crew (and, way later, Fenicia and
Zeffie (AND justine??)) learn about this and they try to do something
about it.
